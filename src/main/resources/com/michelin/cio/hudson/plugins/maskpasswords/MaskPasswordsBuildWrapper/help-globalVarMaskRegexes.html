<div>
    <p>Define a list of regular expression patterns
    to be masked in build output. If the <b>Mask passwords</b> option is enabled on these
    jobs or the <b>Mask Passwords - Enable Globally</b> global option is enabled,
    then the defined regexes will be automatically masked from the console.</p>
    <p>Blank values are not accepted. Patterns will be compiled via
    <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/value/Pattern.html">java.util.value.Pattern</a>.
    Regexes and patterns for defined passwords will be combined with pipes ("|")
    within one large parenthesized pattern to mask from output (i.e. the final pattern to mask
    for two passwords ("Password1" and "Password2") and two regexes ("Regex1" and "Regex2")
    will be: "(Password1|Password2|Regex1|Regex2)").
    </p>
