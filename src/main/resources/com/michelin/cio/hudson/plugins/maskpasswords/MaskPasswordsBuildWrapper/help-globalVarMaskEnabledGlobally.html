    If checked, the MaskPasswordsBuildWrapper will be injected into EVERY Build that does not have it already configured on the Job.
    Builds of anything not derived from hudson.models.Job will fail. Other problems may be encountered. Use this only if you'd rather have
    <span style="color:red">builds fail in strange ways</span> than possibly disclose a secret in build output!
