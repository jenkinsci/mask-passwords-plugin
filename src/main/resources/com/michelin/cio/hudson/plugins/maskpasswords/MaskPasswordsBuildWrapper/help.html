    <p>When enabled, allows masking passwords that may appear in the console.</p>
    <p>Passwords or regexes to be masked can be defined at three levels.</p>
    <p>First, it is possible to select in Hudson's/Jenkins' configuration screen
    the build parameters whose value must be masked. For example, selecting the
    <b>Password Parameter</b> type is a good idea.</p>
    <p>Second, still in Hudson's/Jenkins' configuration screen, it is possible
    to define passwords to be masked as global <b>Name</b>/<b>Password</b>
    pairs, or regexes to be masked.</p>
    <p>Third, on a per job basis (that is, in the current configuration screen),
    passwords to be masked can be defined as local <b>Name</b>/<b>Password</b>
    pairs, or regexes can be masked:<ul>
    <li><b>Password</b> is aimed at containing a password to be masked from the
    console. Empty and blank values are not allowed (e.g. &quot;&nbsp;&quot;,
    etc.). This field is ciphered. This field can not contain variables, they
    won't be expanded.</li>
    <li>If <b>Name</b> is set, then a build variable will be defined accordingly.
    This allows accessing the password by using the variable rather than hard-coding
    it in a field which is not ciphered (e.g. the ones of the <b>Invoke Ant</b> or
    <b>Execute shell</b> build steps).</li>
    <li>If <b>Regex</b> is set, then any text matching that regex will be masked
    in the console output. The regex should not contain start- or end-of-string
    markers and will be internally and-ed (piped) together with all other regexes
    and regexes matching the specified names and passwords.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
